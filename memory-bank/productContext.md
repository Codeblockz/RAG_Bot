# Product Context

## Why This Project Exists
The RAG Chatbot template addresses the growing need for organizations to quickly deploy AI-powered chatbots that can understand and respond to user queries using their own domain-specific knowledge. Traditional chatbots lack the ability to access and reference specific documents, making them less useful for enterprise applications.

## Problems This Solution Solves
1. **Knowledge Silos**: Organizations struggle to make internal documentation searchable and accessible
2. **Time-Consuming Development**: Building custom RAG systems from scratch is time-intensive
3. **Domain Specialization**: Different industries need specialized chatbot capabilities that are hard to implement
4. **Cloud Flexibility**: Need for deployment across multiple cloud providers without major code changes
5. **Production Readiness**: Lack of production-grade features like monitoring, security, and scalability

## How It Should Work
Users can:
- Upload documents in various formats (PDF, DOCX, TXT, etc.)
- Ask questions about the uploaded content
- Receive responses with citations from source documents
- Customize prompts and parameters for different domains
- Deploy to cloud providers with minimal configuration changes

## User Experience Goals
1. **Intuitive Interface**: Simple upload and chat experience
2. **Fast Responses**: Under 2 seconds for typical queries
3. **Accurate Citations**: Clear attribution of source documents
4. **Easy Customization**: Quick adaptation for new domains
5. **Reliable Performance**: 99.9% uptime with proper monitoring

## Technical Requirements
- Modular architecture supporting component swapping
- Support for multiple LLM providers (OpenAI, Anthropic)
- Vector database abstraction (Pinecone, ChromaDB)
- Cloud deployment ready (AWS, Azure)
- Comprehensive testing suite
- Production-grade security and monitoring
