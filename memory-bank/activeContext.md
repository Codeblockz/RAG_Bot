# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
âœ… **Phase 1 Complete** - Successfully implemented the complete core backend infrastructure for the RAG Chatbot template. All foundational components are in place and production-ready.

## Recent Changes
- **Complete FastAPI Application**: Built production-ready FastAPI app with comprehensive middleware stack including CORS, rate limiting, request logging, security headers, and global exception handling
- **Configuration System**: Implemented hierarchical Pydantic Settings with environment variables, YAML overrides, and type-safe validation
- **Service Architecture**: Created complete abstract base classes for all services (LLM, embeddings, vector stores, retrieval strategies, chat services) with Service Factory pattern
- **OpenAI Integration**: Full implementation of OpenAI LLM provider and embeddings service with streaming, batching, cost calculation, and error handling
- **Security & Logging**: Production-ready structured JSON logging, API key authentication, rate limiting, and input validation
- **Development Infrastructure**: Complete Docker setup, testing framework with pytest and fixtures, comprehensive documentation

## Next Steps
Ready to proceed with **Phase 2 - Retrieval & Vector Storage**:
1. Implement Pinecone vector store with full CRUD operations
2. Implement ChromaDB local vector store as fallback option
3. Create similarity search retrieval strategy
4. Build document processing pipeline with text chunking
5. Add document format handlers (PDF, DOCX, TXT, MD)
6. Implement metadata extraction and enrichment

## Active Decisions and Considerations
âœ… **Validated Design Decisions**:
- **FastAPI**: Proven excellent choice - automatic API docs, async support, type hints, middleware ecosystem
- **Modular Architecture**: Abstract base classes + Factory pattern working perfectly for component swapping
- **Configuration-Driven**: YAML + environment variables providing flexible deployment options
- **Production-First**: Security, logging, error handling, and monitoring built from the start
- **Async Throughout**: All I/O operations use async/await for optimal performance

## Important Patterns and Preferences
âœ… **Successfully Implemented**:
- **Strategy Pattern**: All services (LLM, embeddings, vector stores) use pluggable interfaces
- **Factory Pattern**: ServiceFactory manages instances with auto-registration and lifecycle
- **Configuration-Driven**: Complete YAML-based configuration with environment overrides
- **Async Programming**: Full async/await implementation for all I/O operations
- **Structured Logging**: JSON logging with request IDs, contextual information, and performance metrics
- **Security-First**: API keys, rate limiting, input sanitization, security headers all implemented

## Learnings and Project Insights
**Key Insights from Phase 1**:
- **Modular Architecture Works**: The abstract base classes make it trivial to swap components (tested with mock implementations)
- **Configuration Flexibility**: YAML + environment variable system provides excellent deployment flexibility
- **Production Readiness**: Starting with production-ready features (logging, security, error handling) saves significant refactoring later
- **Service Factory**: Registry pattern for auto-discovery of implementations works beautifully
- **Testing Infrastructure**: Comprehensive fixture system enables easy testing of all components

**Template Adaptability Confirmed**:
- Easy to swap LLM providers by implementing LLMProvider interface
- Vector stores can be changed via configuration without code changes
- Domain-specific customization via configuration files
- Docker deployment works seamlessly

## Implementation Approach
âœ… **Phase 1 Complete** (Week 1):
- FastAPI application with middleware stack âœ…
- Configuration management with Pydantic Settings âœ…
- Abstract base classes for all services âœ…
- Service Factory with auto-registration âœ…
- OpenAI LLM and embeddings integration âœ…
- Security and structured logging âœ…
- Docker containerization and testing âœ…

ðŸ”„ **Phase 2 Starting** (Week 2):
- Vector store implementations (Pinecone + ChromaDB)
- Retrieval strategies (similarity, MMR, hybrid)
- Document processing pipeline
- Text chunking and metadata extraction

## Current Status
**Phase 1: Core Backend Infrastructure - COMPLETE** âœ…

The foundation is solid and production-ready:
- **Modularity**: Easy component swapping via abstract interfaces
- **Configuration**: Flexible YAML + environment variable system
- **Security**: API keys, rate limiting, input validation, security headers
- **Observability**: Structured logging, error tracking, performance metrics
- **Development**: Complete testing infrastructure, Docker deployment
- **Documentation**: Comprehensive README and API documentation

**Ready for Phase 2**: Vector Storage and Retrieval implementation.

**Quality Metrics**:
