# Active Context

## Current Work Focus
Initializing the memory bank for the RAG Chatbot template project. This is the foundational phase where we're establishing the core documentation that will guide all future development.

## Recent Changes
- Created project brief document outlining core objectives
- Established product context explaining why this project exists and what problems it solves
- Setting up the foundation for active development work

## Next Steps
1. Create system patterns document to define architectural approaches
2. Develop technical context covering technologies and tools to be used
3. Begin implementation of core backend infrastructure (Phase 1)
4. Set up proper file structure and configuration management

## Active Decisions and Considerations
- Using FastAPI for backend due to its speed and automatic API documentation
- Planning modular architecture with abstract base classes for easy component swapping
- Choosing to support both AWS and Azure deployment options
- Implementing YAML-based configuration for easy customization
- Prioritizing production-ready features from the start

## Important Patterns and Preferences
- Strategy pattern for pluggable components (LLM, embeddings, vector stores)
- Factory pattern for service creation
- Configuration-driven behavior with YAML files
- Asynchronous programming for I/O operations
- Comprehensive logging and monitoring setup
- Security-first approach with proper authentication and validation

## Learnings and Project Insights
The project requires careful attention to modularity from the beginning since this is a template that will be adapted for different domains. The architecture must support easy swapping of components without breaking functionality.

## Implementation Approach
Following the 5-phase development plan:
1. Core Backend Infrastructure (Week 1) - FastAPI setup, configuration management, abstract base classes
2. Retrieval and Vector Storage (Week 2) - Vector database integration, retrieval service
3. Advanced RAG Features (Week 3) - Conversation memory, advanced prompts, citation tracking
4. Frontend Development (Week 4) - React UI with chat interface
5. Production Readiness (Week 5) - Testing, monitoring, deployment setup

## Current Status
Project initialization phase complete. Memory bank foundation established. Ready to begin actual implementation work.
