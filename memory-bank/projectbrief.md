# Project Brief

## Core Objective
Build a production-ready, template-worthy RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) chatbot that can be easily adapted for different domains and use cases through modular architecture and comprehensive cloud deployment strategies.

## Key Value Propositions
- **Modular Architecture**: Strategy pattern implementation allowing easy swapping of LLM providers, vector stores, and embedding services
- **Multi-Cloud Ready**: Native support for AWS and Azure with Infrastructure as Code (Terraform)
- **Domain-Agnostic Design**: YAML-based configuration system enabling rapid customization for any industry
- **Production-Ready**: Comprehensive error handling, monitoring, security, and auto-scaling capabilities
- **Template Reusability**: Abstract base classes and factory patterns for maximum extensibility

## Technical Architecture

### Core Stack
- **Backend**: Python 3.11+, FastAPI, Pydantic for data validation
- **Frontend**: React/Next.js, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS
- **Vector Storage**: Pinecone (primary), ChromaDB (local fallback), Azure Cognitive Search
- **LLM Providers**: OpenAI GPT-4 (primary), Anthropic Claude (configurable)
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (chat history), Redis (caching)
- **Deployment**: Docker, Kubernetes, Terraform, GitHub Actions/Azure DevOps

### Key Design Patterns
- **Strategy Pattern**: Pluggable components (LLM, embeddings, vector stores)
- **Factory Pattern**: Service creation and dependency injection
- **Configuration-Driven**: YAML-based templates and runtime configuration
- **Async/Await**: Non-blocking I/O operations throughout
- **Observability**: Structured logging, metrics, and distributed tracing

## Implementation Strategy

### 5-Phase Development Plan
1. **Phase 1 - Core Backend Infrastructure** (Week 1)
   - FastAPI application with middleware stack

2. **Phase 2 - Retrieval & Vector Storage** (Week 2)
   - Multi-provider vector database integration
   - Advanced retrieval strategies (similarity, MMR, hybrid)
   - Document indexing pipeline with metadata
   - Fallback mechanisms for service availability

3. **Phase 3 - Advanced RAG Features** (Week 3)
   - Conversation memory and context management
   - Sophisticated prompt templates and query processing
   - Citation tracking and source attribution
   - Streaming responses and evaluation framework

4. **Phase 4 - Frontend Development** (Week 4)
   - React chat interface with real-time streaming
   - Document management and upload system
   - Settings panel for runtime configuration
   - Accessibility and responsive design

5. **Phase 5 - Production Readiness** (Week 5)
   - Comprehensive testing suite (unit, integration, E2E)
   - Security hardening and compliance features
   - Monitoring, alerting, and observability stack
   - Multi-cloud deployment automation

## Multi-Cloud Deployment Strategy

### AWS Architecture
- **Compute**: ECS Fargate (containers) or Lambda (serverless)
- **Database**: RDS PostgreSQL, ElastiCache Redis
- **Storage**: S3 (documents), OpenSearch (vector search)
- **CDN**: CloudFront with S3 static hosting
- **Security**: VPC, WAF, Secrets Manager, IAM roles

### Azure Architecture
- **Compute**: AKS (Kubernetes) or Container Instances
- **Database**: PostgreSQL Flexible Server, Redis Cache Premium
- **Storage**: Blob Storage, Cognitive Search (vector search)
- **CDN**: Azure CDN with Static Web Apps
- **Security**: Key Vault, Network Security Groups, RBAC

### Infrastructure as Code
- Terraform modules for both AWS and Azure
- Environment-specific configurations
- Automated CI/CD pipelines with GitHub Actions and Azure DevOps
- One-command deployment scripts for each cloud

## Customization Framework

### Domain Adaptation
- **Prompt Templates**: YAML-based system and legal prompts
- **Document Processing**: Configurable chunking strategies and metadata extraction
- **UI Customization**: Theme system and configurable labels
- **Business Logic**: Plugin architecture for domain-specific processing

### Component Swapping
- **New LLM Providers**: Implement LLMProvider interface
- **Vector Stores**: Implement VectorStore interface with migration scripts
- **Authentication**: Pluggable auth providers (API key, OAuth, SAML)
- **Monitoring**: Multiple observability backends (CloudWatch, Application Insights)

## Quality & Security Standards

### Testing Requirements
- 90%+ test coverage on core functionality
- Unit tests with dependency mocking
- Integration tests for API endpoints and database interactions
- End-to-end workflow testing with performance benchmarks
- RAGAS evaluation framework for RAG quality metrics

### Security Implementation
- API authentication with rate limiting and input validation
- Secure secrets management (AWS Secrets Manager, Azure Key Vault)
- Network isolation with VPC/VNet configurations
- Data encryption at rest and in transit
- GDPR compliance considerations and audit logging

### Production Monitoring
- Real-time performance metrics (response time, token usage, error rates)
- Distributed tracing for request lifecycle visibility
- Cost tracking and optimization recommendations
- Auto-scaling based on demand patterns
- Health checks and service discovery

## Success Criteria

### Technical Metrics
- Response time < 2 seconds for standard queries
- 99.9% uptime with auto-scaling under load
- Support for 1000+ concurrent users
- Infrastructure deployment < 30 minutes via automation
- Zero-downtime deployments through CI/CD

### Business Metrics
- New domain adaptation achievable in < 1 day
- Developer onboarding and productivity in < 2 hours
- Template reusability demonstrated across 3+ different domains
- Cloud migration capability (AWS ↔ Azure) in < 4 hours
- Cost predictability with monthly estimates within ±10%

### Deliverables
- Complete source code with comprehensive documentation
- Multi-cloud deployment automation (AWS + Azure)
- Customization guides with real-world examples
- Security best practices and compliance documentation
- Performance benchmarks and cost optimization guides

## Project Timeline
- **Duration**: 5 weeks with 1 senior developer
- **MVP Milestone**: End of Phase 3 (core RAG functionality)
- **Production Release**: End of Phase 5 (full deployment capabilities)
- **Quality Gates**: Automated testing and security validation at each phase
