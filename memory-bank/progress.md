# Progress

## What Works
- Memory bank initialization is complete with all core documents created
- Project brief establishes clear objectives and value propositions
- Product context defines the problem domain and user experience goals
- System patterns document outlines architectural approaches and design patterns
- Technical context covers all technologies, tools, and development practices
- All foundational documentation is in place for guiding implementation

## What's Left to Build
1. **Core Backend Infrastructure** (Phase 1) - FastAPI setup with proper project structure
2. **Configuration Management System** - Pydantic Settings implementation
3. **Abstract Base Classes** - LLM, embeddings, vector store interfaces
4. **OpenAI Integration** - Primary LLM and embedding service implementations
5. **Document Processing Pipeline** - Text chunking and preprocessing
6. **Logging Setup** - Structured logging with proper configuration
7. **Frontend Foundation** - React/Next.js setup with basic UI components

## Current Status
All memory bank files have been created successfully. The project is now ready to begin implementation work following the 5-phase development plan outlined in the original template.

## Known Issues
No known issues at this time. Memory bank is complete and ready for implementation.

## Evolution of Project Decisions
The decisions made in the memory bank align with the original RAG chatbot template plan:
- Modular architecture approach with abstract base classes
- Configuration-driven design using YAML files
- Multi-cloud deployment strategy (AWS/Azure)
- Production-ready features from the start
- Comprehensive testing and documentation requirements

## Implementation Timeline
Following the 5-phase development plan:
1. **Phase 1** (Week 1): Core Backend Infrastructure - Complete
2. **Phase 2** (Week 2): Retrieval and Vector Storage - Starting next
3. **Phase 3** (Week 3): Advanced RAG Features - To be implemented
4. **Phase 4** (Week 4): Frontend Development - To be implemented
5. **Phase 5** (Week 5): Production Readiness - To be implemented

## Next Steps
1. Begin implementing Phase 1 of the backend infrastructure
2. Set up FastAPI with proper middleware (CORS, rate limiting, logging)
3. Implement configuration management using Pydantic Settings
4. Create abstract base classes in services for pluggable components
5. Implement OpenAI LLM and embedding services
6. Create document processing pipeline with text chunking
7. Set up comprehensive logging with structured output

## Notes for Future Reference
- All implementation should follow the patterns and decisions established in the memory bank
- Maintain modularity to support easy component swapping
- Ensure configuration can be changed without code modifications
- Keep security considerations in mind throughout development
- Follow testing strategy outlined in tech context documentation
